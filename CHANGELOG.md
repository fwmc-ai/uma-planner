  - **New Design**: Full-width prominent box with colored left border and background
  - **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Large icons (üö® ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚úÖ üìä) and bigger text
  - **Enhanced Critical Alerts**: Red styling with additional "Quick Fix" guidance
  - **Positioning**: Moved from header badge to standalone box below character info
- **Files Modified**: `index.html` (lines ~1137-1199, ~1650-1656)
- **Impact**: ‚úÖ Critical feedback is now highly visible and actionable
